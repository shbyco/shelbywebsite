These files are .json files that are meant to be uploaded to the Divi WordPress Theme to be properly used. You can optionally use the 
Divi builder plugin on your own theme.

HOW TO INSTALL THE PLUGIN: Go to http://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/divi-builder/ and purchase the plugin.

HOW TO INSTALL THE FILES ONTO DIVI:

First, After downloading and acitvating the theme and or plugin, you should have the .json files saved to your computer provided from our page on GitHub. Then you will go to your WordPress dashboard.
Then you will head over the control panel on the left side and hover over the button that reads ‘Divi’. Next, Divi Library.
On the top left will be two buttons, one saying ‘Manage Categories’ and one saying ‘Import & Export. Click on ‘Import & Export’.
It should open a purple pop-up box with two tabs. Click on the tab titled ‘Import’. Finally, you will be able to upload the .JSON file from your computer.
After the file has imported you will need to go to the page that you intend on importing the layout on to. From there you will activate the Divi Builder, then hit ‘Load From Library’ then select the tab that reads ‘Add From Library” and find the layout labeled ‘Shelby Company Homepage’.
You now have complete access to the files and images we used on our homepage and blog right on your own website. Feel free to use this design in any way you would like!
